# Dijkstra Algorithm in Javascript 
## solving a given problem

This is the solution of a coding challenge for finding the shortest path between the given start and end point in a given graph (generatedGraph.json).
The problem was solved by using the Dijkstra algorithm implemented in Javascript.


### Solution

**The cheapest path from start point "Erde" (earth) to the planet b3-r7-r4nd7:**
[18 (start), 810, 595, 132, 519, 71, 432, 246 (target)]

**Distance:** 2.99568
